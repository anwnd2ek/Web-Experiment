<h2>Jazz</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/jazz" target="_blank" title="Jazz definition">Jazz</a> is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States.<br></p>
<p>It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime.<br> Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music".<br> Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression.<br> It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation.</p>
